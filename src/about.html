            <p>Recently, I have embarked on my first web development project from scratch, which has been an exciting new challenge.
                This website is my first full-fledged development project, and I am eager to continue learning and growing in this area.
                In fact, I utilized AI technologies to assist in building and optimizing this site, highlighting my interest in the future of AI.</p>

            <p>When I'm not immersed in engineering projects, exploring AI technologies, or learning about web development, I spend my time on DIY activities.
                There's something incredibly satisfying about creating something tangible with my own hands, whether it's through home improvement projects or tinkering with electronics.</p>
            <p>Welcome to my personal webpage where you can learn more about my work and hobbies.
